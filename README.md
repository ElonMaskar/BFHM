## Introduction

Image matting is an important problem in computer vision with many practical applications. Traditional approaches have relied on hand-crafted features and optimization methods, but recent advances in deep learning have shown promising results.

In this repository, we provide code for training and evaluating deep neural networks for image matting. Our approach is based on a fully convolutional network architecture that can be trained end-to-end on large datasets.

## Data

We use the Adobe Deep Image Matting (DIM) dataset for training and evaluation. This dataset consists of 50 high-resolution images with corresponding alpha mattes and foreground objects. We also provide scripts for preprocessing the data and generating augmented versions for data augmentation.

## Model Architecture

Our model architecture is based on a fully convolutional encoder-decoder network with skip connections. The encoder extracts features from the input image, while the decoder generates a mask that represents the foreground object. Skip connections help preserve spatial information and improve performance.

## Training

We train our model using stochastic gradient descent with the Adam optimizer. We use a batch size of 16 and train for 100 epochs. We also use data augmentation techniques such as random cropping, flipping, and color jittering to improve generalization.

## Results

Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Adobe DIM dataset, with an average intersection-over-union (IoU) score of 0.93. We also provide visualizations of the predicted alpha mattes and foreground objects for qualitative evaluation.

## Usage

To use our code, first clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ElonMaskar/image-matting.git
cd image-matting
